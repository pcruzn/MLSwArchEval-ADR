# Title

Command connector based on os.system()


## Context

- ??

## Decision

- A command-and-control orchestrator uses command execution for calling domain logic components such as training components. (se pasan parámetros mediante un string después de Trian.py y se reciben en Train.py utilizando sys.argv)


Example:
```
os.system("python Train.py")
```

## Status

- Implemented.

## Consequences

- Components communication is easy to understand and easy to maintain.
- Security is compromised as this kind of command calls are subject to potentially unwanted commands to be executed.
- Orchestrator component losses control on the command response.
